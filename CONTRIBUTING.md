# How to contribute to Rubik

### Did you find a bug?

- **Search** for the bug under [issues](https://github.com/rubikorg/rubik/issues) section first. 
Do not open a GitHub issue unless the bug is not reported. You can provide your analysis 
on the bug on the issue which was reported before you. This helps us to think in a different 
angle which can lead to quick resolution of the said bug.
- If you did not find your issue [create an issue](https://github.com/rubikorg/rubik/issues/new)
with the prefix `Bug:` and then your title.
- Keep the title understandable and short. If possible write a descriptive message about the
scenario that created this bug.

The Rubik Framework is split up into 3 projects:
- [Core](https://github.com/rubikorg/rubik)
- [CLI](https://github.com/rubikorg/okrubik)
- [Blocks](https://github.com/rubikorg/blocks)

**Please make sure that you have created the issue in relavent project, which will help us tag
and fix the issue quickly.**

### Did you fix an issue?

Great! We are one step furthur for a stable release. The fixes always goes through in the 
`rubik-one` branch. _(because currently we are developing for Rubik One release)_.
- Create a branch from `your-fork/rubik-one` to apply your fix.
- Create a PR accross forks and set target branch as `rubikorg/rubik/rubik-one`.

> **Success!** We'll review your PR for side-effects and causalities and merge it as soon as 
	possible.

### Do you want to propose a new feature?

Anything that is not present in the current version and extends the functionality of Rubik can
be considered as a feature. We'd love to hear your opinions and take your proposals into 
consideration unless it does not affect our end goal -- **To keep a small core**. 

- Create an issue with `Proposal:` prefix.

Before you do that you need to understand that this framework doesn't try to do everything but
something and that something as good as possible. That being said rejection is the subset of 
such ideology and it should not let you down in any way.

### Do you have questions about source code?

We dont have a mailing list yet but this [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/t3dEdT) is always 
open for questions.

### Do you want to contribute to Rubik Documentation?

We aim to provide good resources for new projects but many times it does not turn out to reach
into the minds of developers that read. You can help us deliver that experience by:

- Cloning this [repository](https://github.com/rubikorg/rubikorg.github.io)
- Creating a new branch with your documentation contributions from the `docs` branch.
- Create a PR with target branch as `docs` accross forks.

Rubik is meant and will always to be an open-source project and an collaborative effort, 
so you can directly pitch in with proposals and fixes without any hesitations.

Thanks! ðŸ’Ÿ

From, Rubik Team and the World!
