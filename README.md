# Rubik

## A very fast, productive, generatable microservice framework

[Homepage](https://rubikorg.github.io) - [API Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rubikorg/rubik?tab=doc)

For writing REST client and server-side applications faster. It provides a pluggable
layer of abstraction over `net/http` and enables automation of development environment through extensive tooling.

Even though the goal of Rubik is set it'll take a lot of time to achieve it, that being said you must
not use this framework for any production use **yet**. There can be a lot of edge cases missed and
bug fixes beyond the grasps which needs to be fixed before it is **production ready**.
